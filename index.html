			<h1>Jackson Hole</h1>
			<h2>Home of Grand Teton National Park</h2>
				
			<p>Jackson Hole is a valley encompassed by mountains. The valley is 48 miles long and 8 to 15 miles wide, and the valley floor slopes from 6,779 feet above sea level in the north to about 6,069 feet at the southern end.</p>

			<p> In 1929, Grand Teton National Park was created and dedicated. The park at that time included the mountains in the Teton Range and a narrow strip of land that contained the major lakes at the base of the peaks. But that was enough to develop the tourism industry, which has now replaced cattle ranching as the primary economic base of Jackson Hole . In 1950, the park was enlarged to include the Jackson Hole National Monument , established in 1943. The rededicated park contains 52 square miles, acquired by John D. Rockefeller, Jr., during the 1930's and 40's. Grand Teton National Park now totals 485 square miles or 310,000 acres.</p>

			<p>Women in Wyoming have been voting since 1869, when the legislature of Wyoming Territory met for the first time, the first government in the world to grant women full voting rights. But in 1920, the year the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution gave women across the nation the right to vote, Jackson added to its legendary history by electing an all-female city council, among the first in the United States. The elected women of Jackson proved their mettle by increasing the town treasury, improving the water system, getting rid of the garbage in the streets, grading the roads, and beautifying the cemeteryâ€”a very ambitious agenda. Note: Popular history often names Jackson Hole as the first all-female city council. However, the Jackson Hole Historical Society and Museum has found that Oskaloosa, Kansas may have claim to that title. They elected a woman mayor and 4 town councilwomen in 1888.</p>
